# Coding standards

> Coding standards for HTML, (S)CSS and JavaScript development.

These guidelines and coding standards are compiled from various sources such as Google and GitHub in the hope of creating a reference for web development.

Compiling these on GitHub means I can easily update them, as they evolve, as well as importing them for use on other projects.


## General principles

- Keep your code clean. Seperate CSS into a .css file, JavaScript into a .js file etc;
- Use soft-tabs with a two space indent;
- Avoid compressing your code, that's the app/servers job. If you do, be sure to provide an uncompressed and commented version;


## Table of contents

- [HTML](html.md)
- [CSS](css.md)
  - [SCSS](scss.md)
- [JavaScript](javascript.md)
  - [jQuery](javascript-jquery.md)


## Sources include...

- [GitHub styleguide](https://github.com/styleguide/)
- [Google HTML/CSS style guide](http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/htmlcssguide.xml)
- [SMACSS](http://smacss.com/)


## Final thought *from Google* that I agree completely with...

Be consistent.

If you're editing code, take a few minutes to look at the code around you and determine its style.
If they use spaces around all their arithmetic operators, you should too.
If their comments have little boxes of hash marks around them, make your comments have little boxes of hash marks around them too.

If code you add to a file looks drastically different from the existing code around it, it throws readers out of their rhythm when they go to read it. Avoid this.
